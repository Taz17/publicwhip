# This one used for checking the ordering of divisions by date.
# Chronologically it is later than division_id 59, but the sql returns it
# before that division when no orderby clause is used.
# Unfortunately that behaviour is arbitrary, and changing the test fixtures or
# the environment will likely change that order. One Solution would be to
# mock out the sql calls.
