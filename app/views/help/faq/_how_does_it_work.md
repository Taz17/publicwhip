Debate transcripts of the House of Representatives and the Senate are published online as [Hansard](https://www.openaustralia.org.au/hansard/). <%= inline_project_name %> takes these records and compiles lists of votes that you can access under [Divisions](/divisions). You can [search these votes](/search) or you can browse the votes that are relevant to the particular policy areas listed under [Policies](/policies) (for more on our policies, see [What are Policies and how do they work?](#policies)).

If you're wondering why we don't source our information from the official record of how people voted, [Votes and Proceedings](http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Chamber_documents/HoR/Votes_and_Proceedings) or [Journals of the Senate](http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Chamber_documents/Senate_chamber_documents/Journals_of_the_Senate), it's because they're not published in any useable form by Parliament. It would make everyone's life so much easier if these were available in an open and machine-readable format.
