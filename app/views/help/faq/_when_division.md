Most decisions in Parliament are made
[‘on the voices’](https://peo.gov.au/understand-our-parliament/how-parliament-works/parliament-at-work/voting-in-parliament/)
and not by division. When a question is asked by the Chair, the Members of Parliament (MPs) or
Senators call out Yes or No and the Chair decides which are in the majority without
recording the names of who voted and how they voted.

A division is only called if two or more MPs or Senators call for one. If only one MP or Senator
calls for a division then their name may be recorded in the official record (the Hansard) but no
division will occur.

In the House of Representatives, if there are four or less MPs on a side of the division then the
division does not proceed and the Speaker declares the decision of the House immediately.
However, the names of the MPs in the minority are recorded.

In the Senate, if there is only one Senator on a side of the division then the division does not
proceed and the President declares the decision of the Senate immediately. However, the names
of the lone Senator may be recorded.
