In the House of Representatives, the Speaker
[does not vote](http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/voting-in-the-chambers.html)
unless the result is a tie, in which case
[the Speaker has the casting vote](http://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/house_of_representatives/powers_practice_and_procedure/~/link.aspx?_id=8485A681FB314882871407C0A81BE62C&_z=z#thesp)
to decide the matter. Speakers are expected to cast their vote according to a set of principles
but these have not always been applied consistently (of course!).

There are also rare cases where the Speaker has not exercised a casting vote. For example when a
vote that
[requires an absolute majority](http://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/house_of_representatives/powers_practice_and_procedure/~/link.aspx?_id=9401351F60524BBF93050639FBA28300&_z=z#abs)
is tied, the Speaker’s casting vote may not achieve an absolute majority so there’s no reason for
them to exercise that vote.

In the Senate, the President of the Senate may always vote along with other senators so they do not
have a casting vote. If a vote in the Senate is tied it is
[considered to have failed](http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/voting-in-the-chambers.html)
because a majority vote has not been reached.
